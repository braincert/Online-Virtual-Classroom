# REST API
BrainCert provides a RESTful interface to the resources in the Virtual Classroom e.g. classes, video recordings, shopping cart, etc. Once your API key has authenticated a BrainCert user, it can call a REST API endpoint using the obtained access token and get the corresponding resources. A simple example is getting the authenticated user's list of live classes using the API endpoint. 

If you are new to REST, you can understand the basics at http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/REST. Please note that the endpoints support JSON (recommended) and XML. The documentation allows you to get responses using JSON or XML where relevant.

Virtual Classroom API supports scheduling and launching live classes, record sessions in HD (MP4 format), HD audio/video conference, desktop sharing, group chat, file sharing, interactive whiteboards, share presentations, sell classes using shopping cart, create discount coupons - all from within your own website.
